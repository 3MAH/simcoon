Overview
========

Simcoon provides a comprehensive library of constitutive models organized 
into three main categories:

- **Finite Strain Models**: Hyperelastic models for large deformations
- **Mechanical Models**: Small strain mechanical models (elasticity, plasticity, damage)
- **Thermomechanical Models**: Coupled thermal-mechanical models
