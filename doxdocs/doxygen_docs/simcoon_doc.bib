abstract = {This chapter is conceived primarily as an account of certain interrelated ideas that have contributed over a long period to the basic mechanics of rate-independent solids and which retrospectively appear to have proved influential. Central to this method is the representation of tensors on trace axes of deformation that sweep through a Lagrangian reference configuration. A Lagrangian viewpoint is also well suited to handling pure mechanics, as it is advocated in relation to incremental boundary-value problems. With “nominal” stress as the primary variable, allied to the notion of convexity with respect to functional, one has an infallible structural guide when investigating uniqueness of solutions and their external characters. The chapter also highlights that the failure of incremental uniqueness, or bifurcation, is arguably the phenomenon that is most typical of continuum response at unrestricted levels of deformation. It is in constitutive analyses of material behaviors that the mathematical apparatus assembled at the outset finds its justification. {\textcopyright} 1978, Academic Press Inc.},

@article{Nguyen2016a,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer International Publishing.The roles of the consistent Jacobian matrix and the material tangent moduli, which are used in nonlinear incremental finite deformation mechanics problems solved using the finite element method, are emphasized in this paper, and demonstrated using the commercial software ABAQUS standard. In doing so, the necessity for correctly employing user material subroutines to solve nonlinear problems involving large deformation and/or large rotation is clarified. Starting with the rate form of the principle of virtual work, the derivations of the material tangent moduli, the consistent Jacobian matrix, the stress/strain measures, and the objective stress rates are discussed and clarified. The difference between the consistent Jacobian matrix (which, in the ABAQUS UMAT user material subroutine is referred to as DDSDDE) and the material tangent moduli (Ce) needed for the stress update is pointed out and emphasized in this paper. While the former is derived based on the Jaumann rate of the Kirchhoff stress, the latter is derived using the Jaumann rate of the Cauchy stress. Understanding the difference between these two objective stress rates is crucial for correctly implementing a constitutive model, especially a rate form constitutive relation, and for ensuring fast convergence. Specifically, the implementation requires the stresses to be updated correctly. For this, the strains must be computed directly from the deformation gradient and corresponding strain measure (for a total form model). Alternatively, the material tangent moduli derived from the corresponding Jaumann rate of the Cauchy stress of the constitutive relation (for a rate form model) should be used. Given that this requirement is satisfied, the consistent Jacobian matrix only influences the rate of convergence. Its derivation should be based on the Jaumann rate of the Kirchhoff stress to ensure fast convergence; however, the use of a different objective stress rate may also be possible. The error associated with energy conservation and work-conjugacy due to the use of the Jaumann objective stress rate in ABAQUS nonlinear incremental analysis is viewed as a consequence of the implementation of a constitutive model that violates these requirements.},
