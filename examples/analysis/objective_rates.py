"""
Comparison of objective rates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This example show the well-known spurious oscillations that can occur in the
Zaremba-Jauman rate when simulating elastic responses under large transformations.
The results are compared with the Green-Naghdi and logarithmic Xiao-Meyers-Bruhns rates,
which do not exhibit such oscillations.

# Note that the Jaumann rate exhibits spurious oscillations in the stress and strain response,
# while the Green-Naghdi and Logarithmic rates provide smooth responses.
# This is a well-known issue with the Jaumann rate when dealing with large simple shear transformation.
# The Green-Naghdi and Logarithmic rates do not suffer from this problem, making them more suitable
# for simulations involving large deformations and rotations.
#
# While logarithmic rates are often considered the most accurate for large deformations,
# please note that the induced rotation is however not correct. Only the Green-Naghdi rate provides the exact rotation
# for rigid body motions corresponding to the RU (or VR) decomposition.
