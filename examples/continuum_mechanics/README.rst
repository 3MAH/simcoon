Continuum Mechanics Examples
-----------------------------------------------

Below are examples illustrating Simcoon's main features. 
These examples are designed to serve as tutorials. 
In that sense, an effort is made to keep the scripts simple and executable with 
a low computational cost.

This gallery contains examples demonstrating:

- **Constitutive relations** - Building stiffness and compliance tensors for various material symmetries
- **Stress measures** - Converting between different stress measures (Cauchy, PK1, PK2, etc.)
- **Rotation operations** - Rotating tensors and vectors
- **Yield criteria** - von Mises, Tresca, Drucker, and Hill anisotropic criteria
