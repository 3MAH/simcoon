Heterogeneous materials simulation
-----------------------------------------------

Below are examples illustrating Simcoon's capabilities for simulating heterogeneous materials.

This gallery contains examples demonstrating:

- **Eshelby tensors** - Computing Eshelby and Hill interaction tensors for various inclusion shapes
- **Micromechanics** - Effective properties using Mori-Tanaka and self-consistent schemes, effect of volume fraction and aspect ratio
